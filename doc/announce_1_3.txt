I'm pleased to announce the release of tcpflow version 1.3.0.

Key elements in 1.3.0 include:
- Compiles with mingw32 and mingw64 for 32-bit and 64-bit windows. I am now
distributing pre-compiled binaries of some releases.
- Better support for DFXML (fixed some bugs)

You can download version 1.3.0, both source and precompiled windows binaries,
